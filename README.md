# Advent of Code 2023! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges, written in Dart 3. My objective is simply to solve the challenges, get a correct result and improve my Dart skills. Nothing fancy like optimizing for speed or code golfing, sorry :(

## Run the code

1. Install Dart. Go [here](https://dart.dev/get-dart) for an installation guide.

2. Clone the repo and cd into it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/francisconicola/advent_of_code_2023
    cd advent_of_code_2023
    ```

3. Get dependencies.

    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```

4. Run the code.

    ```bash
    dart run advent_of_code_2023 -d1 -p1 -i input/01/part_1.txt
    ```

    You can use `--help` for parameter explanations.

5. Run the tests with the example files.

    ```bash
    dart test -r expanded
    ```
